# Welcome users!
This repository hosts the public code of the Discord bot named Disguard
#### The bot is currently in Alpha phase
Frequent updates are made to this code. Right now, the bot is actively being updated to bring it completely up to par with where its successor, RicoBot, is. Following that process, work will be done to bring my own fleet of features to the table.
#### But you can take part in the development!
The code is here on GitHub. Anyone who is proficient with coding can make a pull request, and if the changes are agreed upon, then your work may be featured in Disguard. If you would like to make suggestions, then invite the bot to your server and gather your impressions. Then you can join the support server (link below) and add suggestions. Those suggestions will be approved or denied by me, and I will work on them with time. As with any alpha development, I highly encourage people to leave their opinions on the bot.
