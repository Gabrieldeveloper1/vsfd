# Disguard
### An advanced logging, antispam, moderation, and cybersecurity bot working for you
My vision with Disguard is to simplify the process of managing Discord servers, especially complex or large ones, with a variety of features. I seek to innovate in the field of management bots so that server managers can spend less time caught up keeping tabs on their server manually and more time interacting with their community and living their lives. Disguard provides features that automate or simplify many aspects of server management, such as sophisticated event logging, moderation commands, antispam filters, and more.

Although the bot is fully open source and on GitHub, it's not intended to be distributed to be installed and run on individual machines like some Javascript bots do. Everyone is welcome to clone or submit pull requests to the repository if you wish to contribute to the project. If you were seeking to customize the bot yourself and need a small custom bot, feel free to contact me - I do make custom bots for free as long as they're relatively simple.

### Disguard is emerging from its beta phase
After having spent quite some time in beta phase, I now have plans to publicly release Disguard in early 2022. While Disguard was always public, it was never listed or advertised anywhere. When Disguard is officially released, it'll have a more "public" appearance and will be listed on sites such as top.gg, and I will submit a request to Discord for verification once it grows large enough.
