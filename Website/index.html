            <p id="desc">We've all been there. We all know what it's like to be raided. Avoid the pain of being raided with Disguard, a powerful bot that can automatically mute, 
                kick, or ban people who raid your server. Don't like automation? We got that covered too. The bot can be configured to flag messages it deems as spam, and 
                let the mods do the decision making. After all, we're not quite to the point of automation being everything. This bot also contains a full suite of moderation
                features such as quick commands to mute, kick, ban members, and more. Once you see the full selection of options and customization offered by Disguard, you'll
                most likely feel that your other moderation and logging bots aren't useful anymore. Finally, this bot is currently 100% free, so don't pay premiums for
                features you can get here for free!
