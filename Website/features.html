                    Don't let a flood of messages from spammers stop your server from functioning. Disguard offers antispam filters that can mute members for sending too many messages
                    over a short time frame, or mute members for sending the same messages in a row. Disguard also has you covered if you want to block accounts under a certain age
                    from joining your server, or if you only want filters to apply to certain roles. Finally, an interactive purge command provides a walkthrough if you need to purge
                    messages a certain frame, in a certain selection of channels, and many more filters.

                    Minimize interuptions to your server with Disguard's moderation commands, designed for efficiency, intuitivity, and bulk use in mind. Disguard offers mute,
                    lock (prevent channel access), kick, ban, and purge commands with customizable features. When applicable, Disguard will keep track of which roles and
                    channel permissions members had so they can be returned to members once their timeout is up.

                    With the informational features found in Disguard's server logging suite, you'll get a full rundown of changes made in your server. Disguard's logging
                    offers a setting to look at the audit log, allowing you to see which moderator performed actions right from the log embed. Message edit logs offer
                    details on the edit history of messages, and enabling attachment logging enables message delete logs to display images or attachments on deletion.
                    Events that deal with permissions will break down the changes on the log embed, and member join logs will tell you exactly which invite was used
                    to bring the new member into the server (and who created said invite). This is just a small number of the innovative logging features that are

                    Disguard's main focus is to assist server moderators by making their jobs easier, but that's not all it can do. Disguard offers a variety of other
                    features ranging from helpful utility features to a birthdays module. Need to undo an accidental embed suppression? Disguard has you covered as long
                    as the respective feature is enabled on the web dashboard. Disguard's birthdays module allows you to set your birthday, and moderators can choose to
                    have birthdays for the day announced to a channel if desired, and more. Reddit feeds allow you to get content updates from your favorite subreddits,
                    and an info command allows you to pull up helpful information about server objects, such as members, roles, or even invites. Want to check what your
                    custom statuses were last month? If you enable attribute tracking, you can view attribute history of yourself and members who consent to the feature.

                    Open source means that the source is code is publicly accessible for anyone to view or edit. Disguard's code is open source on GitHub, so that everyone
                    can view direct changes to the code and be assured of what Disguard does behind the scenes. Fellow developers: pull requests are welcome! If you think
                    that something is missing, you're most welcome to either add it or discuss it with me. One benefit of being open source is community interaction, and
                    I strive to listen to everyone seeking for their comments to be heard. If anyone encounters issues with the bot, or wishes to provide any type of comment,
                    you're highly encouraged to voice that in Disguard's support server or on GitHub. Both channels may be accessed from the link bar on the top of the website.
                    If you encounter an issue while using the bot, Disguard also provides an integrated ticket system. This may be triggered by using the feedback command or
                    as one of the reaction options on error codes.
