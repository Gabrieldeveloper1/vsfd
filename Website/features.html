            <p class="desc-right-title">Bring the gate down on raiders</p>
            <p class="desc-right-desc">Let's face it: nobody likes being raided, all for good reason. The chat locks up because people spam too fast, and user accounts aren't able to do
                anything without restarting their client sometimes. Images are spammed, and in general, it's not fun cleaning up after raiders. Fortunately, Disguard's
                main features include a dynamic anti-spam system, with advanced features and algorithms to stop raiders in their tracks. When enabled through the online
                setup page, the bot provides a vast suite of customizable commands and features to prevent spam of all types.

            <p class="desc-left-title">Rapidly moderate</p>
            <p class="desc-left-desc">There will be times when you need to bring your foot down or use the ban hammer. Don't wait for other bots to take several 
                seconds to carry out a simple message purge. Disguard comes packed with a library of essential moderation commands, with the most commonly used commands being
                the quick kick, mute, and purge commands. Every moderation command is integrated with the signature embed viewer, giving you keen insight on your possible
                actions, in addition with providing you feedback on what action the bot has done. Finally, if logging is enabled, the bot will post a detailed log message
                in your set log channel, explaining the command used and what the bot has done.

            <p class=desc-right-title>Full-fledged logging</p>
            <p class=desc-right-desc>We see logging bots all over Discord. But not every bot offers all the feature you can get here, with a bot dedicated to logging
                as part of its set of features. Image logging is a pretty new feature, and a miniscule number of bots offer it. Disguard is among those few, offering
                image logging with no strings attached, enabled under logging in the setup. Going over to the more standard features, Disguard allows you to enable or
                disable logging for each individual event, as long as for certain categories, giving you full flexibility. Finally, you can pause logging for a times
                period if it is necessary. Oh, one more thing: this bot can tell you who's been snooping around deleting messages and updating channel topics (and of 
                course everything else too). No more wondering who's been up to no good. All credit goes to the server audit logs, plus you save yourself a few clicks.

            <p class=desc-left-title>Secure your servers</p>
            <p class=desc-left-desc>Disguard offers a rating system to let you know how secure your server is, and how ready it is to handle the dangers of the cyber
                world. You can see the rating for a specific channel or the entire server. After the bot analyzes your server or channel, it will display where your
                server is secure and where your server is not secure. It will tell you what you can do to improve your server's security, which you can choose to 
                follow or ignore depending on how you plan to use your server (public servers are quite noticeable less secure than private servers). This command takes
                note of both the wonderful features built into Discord itself and the the features built into Disguard.

            <p class=desc-right-title>Flexible profanity filter</p>
            <p class=desc-right-desc>Disguard offers a profanity filter that can be customized to your liking. Would you like people to be muted for saying one word,
                but be banned for saying another? Then Disguard's profanity filter setting, part of the anti-spam module, is for you. This sophisticated system includes
                the ability to use a default list of profane words or add your own words in addition to or in replacement for the default list. Each word includes the
                ability to set a consequence and exception rules, in addition to other settings.

            <p class=desc-left-title>Sophisticated embed viewer</p>
            <p class=desc-left-desc>The secret sauce behind Disguard's core features is the signature embed viewer system. Essentially every feature you use Disguard
                with makes use of Discord Embeds to provide visual feedback, options for your current command, and navigation by clicking reactions. While the 
                information appears visually organized, this also has the benefit of streamlining moderation, logging, and anti-spam by reducing the time needed
                to execute some commands. Finally, you are easily able to see the possible options you may use for moderation commands, you can view additional information
                for every log message, and you can review the consequences given to members upon being flagged by the anti-spam system.
