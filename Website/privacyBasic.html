                This page holds Disguard's privacy policy. A longer version can be accessed at <a href="privacy.html">this link</a> - the short version exists to communicate things without overloading people with information.
                Disguard as an umbrella includes the bot (running on Discord), the web Dashboard, and its website (this site) as being developed by me. Throughout the Privacy Policy ("Policy"),
                "Disguard" will represent the bot, "Website" will represent the website, "Dashboard" will represent the configuration web dashboard, and "Database" will represent a third-party
                database provider used by Disguard. "We" represents me (the solo developer of Discord), Disguard itself, and anything developed by me (such as the Website & Database).
            </p>
            <p class="subheader" id="preface">Contact & Disclaimers</p>
            <p class="lgray">
                I (the developer of Disguard) can be contacted through Discord (join the support server or create a support ticket through the bot). We are not affiliated with Discord Inc. in any way.
            </p>
            <p class="subheader" id="preface">Disguard's Providers</p>
            <p class="lgray">
                    • Disguard's Dashboard provider is Heroku. View Heroku's security policy <a href="https://www.heroku.com/compliance">here</a>.
                <br>• Disguard's Database provider is MongoDB. View MongoDB's security policy <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/trust">here</a>.
                <br>• Disguard's Website provider is Netlify. View Netlify's security policy <a href="https://www.netlify.com/security/">here</a>.
                <br>• Disguard itself is self-hosted on a laptop running at my house as of patch 0.2.25. Thus, the bot itself is not subject to third party regulations from a VPS.
            </p>
            <p class="subheader" id="preface">Data We Collect</p>
            <p class="lgray">
                Disguard's Dashboard does not track system information (like IP addresses) as of now, but does stores a cookie to manage the Discord session. This cookie includes your User ID in order to perform database
                operations. This cookie is necessary due to the Oauth2 flow (logging in via Discord). When you connect your account to Disguard for the first time, Disguard only needs to know
                your Username & ID. Traffic through this site is subject to Heroku's policies.<br><br>
                Disguard's website is static unlike the Dashboard, so no data transfers are performed here on my end. Traffic through this site is subject to Netlify's policies.<br><br>
                Disguard's database does not collect data in-and-of itself, but this data rather is created from either the bot itself or the web Dashboard. The database stores long-term
                configuration or customization data for every server Disguard is in and every User who shares at least one server with Disguard. For an outline of data that is stored here,
                see this page for server data, and this page for user data.<br><br>
                The bot itself collects data that powers its operations in some way. The following list is not exhaustive, as it will not include many database settings - that can be
                viewed above. "Cache" represents data only existing within the bot's memory. "Temporary" means this data will be purged after a definite amount of time. "Database"
                means this data is stored in the Database. "Local" means this data is stored on the hard drive of Disguard's host machine. Listings without a prefix just mean the bot
                may access this data for features that use it. Any specific questions about usage can be directed to me.<br>
                <br>• Local - Message Index Data (message content, author, ID, and timestamp)
                <br>• Local - Message Attachments - only if enabled by the server moderators under logging settings for purposes of restoring upon message deletion
                <br>• Database - Your username, user ID, and avatar
                <br>• Database - History of your username, avatar, and custom status.
                <br>• Database - Timestamps you were last online & last active. This feature will be disabled as of patch 0.2.25 until further notice.
                <br>• Database - Auto-calculated "general channel", "moderator channel", and "announcement channel" per server
                <br>• Cache - listing of Message IDs of all pinned messages
                <br>• Cache - listing of all channels
                <br>• Cache - listing of all server invites
                <br>• Cache - listing of all server roles
                <br>• Cache - listing of all members' permissions
                <br>• Cache - Database server & user configuration data for quick lookups
                <br>• Temporary cache - timestamps of when a member joins your server if antispam's repeated joins feature is enabled
                <br>• Temporary cache - reaction data if ghost reaction logging is enabled
                <br>• Server audit-log data for logging (if applicable)
                <br>• Server data as a whole (including roles, etc.)
                <br>• Message data as a whole - especially for events that trigger for each message sent in a server (such as antispam)
            </p>
            <p class="subheader" id="preface">Manage your Data</p>
            <p class="lgray">
                You may access all data that Disguard stores outside of its cache using the .data command. Data that is not customizable by the end user is deemed necessary to the
                bot's normal functionality, and in most cases, can't be removed while you actively use the bot, but contact me about this first.<br><br>Disguard only stores data as
                long as it is necessary to. Upon Disguard leaving a server, that server's data (database & local storage) will be purged. Upon users no longer sharing any mutual
                servers with the bot, that user's data will be purged. In the future, people may be able to 'deactivate' themselves from Disguard, removing data yet surrendering all
                functionality with the bot other than server-enforcement data (like antispam, logging, etc.)
